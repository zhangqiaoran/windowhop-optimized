///   owns invisible helper windows.
///

/// is only accepted when it is the unambiguous best choice for BOTH sides: the
/// candidate is this request's clear winner *and* the request is that
/// candidate's clear winner. Anything ambiguous stays unassigned — the tile then
/// keeps its placeholder, because a preview of the wrong window is worse than no
